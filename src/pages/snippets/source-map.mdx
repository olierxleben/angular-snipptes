import BlogImage from "@components/BlogImage.astro";
import SourceMap from "@images/source-map.jpg";

Do you want to upload source-map to an reporting tool like
@datadoghq
, but want to make sure no one can debug the code due to sourceMap

---

Set below property in build options, the source-map will not be mapped to the bundle, but you will get a source map.

```json
"sourceMap": {
  "hidden": true,
}
```

<BlogImage src={SourceMap} alt="hidden source map for production" />
